              If the road takes you to China, there is one place you must not
              miss. It is a Forbidden City. The Forbidden City covers an area of
              close to 72 hectares, while the total area of this magnificent
              building is a little more than 140,000 square meters. Legend
              testifies that in this building there are 9999 rooms and over 90
              palaces with courtyards. The division into three parts of the
              Forbidden City was made. There is: the defences, the outer court
              and the inner court. If you are going to visit Forbidden City, you
              must have a mask, green health code, registration form for
              temporary residence (required by hotels).

              Since it is much smaller than its original size, it is predicted
              to disappear over time. So don't forget to put the Dead Sea on the
              list of tourist destinations that you must visit. The Dead Sea has
              been attracting tourists from all over the world for thousands of
              years. This is also the largest natural spa in the world, which is
              rich in minerals that are considered medicinal and medically
              useful. Cleopatra made cosmetic preparations from medicinal
              products from the Dead Sea, while the ancient Egyptians used mud
              from this lake in the process of mummification. Waters of the Dead
              Sea, the salt water from this lake has many minerals such as:
              sodium, bromine, potassium and magnesium, and all of them together
              are useful for humans. At the bottom of this lake there is clay
              that tourists apply to themselves due to its healing
              properties.The Dead Sea got its name from the fact that there is
              no animal world in it that you can usually find in other seas. All
              this is of course due to the large amount of salt contained in it.

              Another unusual place will be on our list of Top 10 Attractions
              Must See in Asia. It is a Ha Long Bay. If there is one bay that is
              divine to most of the world's great travelers, it is Ha Long Bay.
              Apart from giving a beautiful picture, these islands also have
              unusual names, so some of them are Pencil, Bison, Turtle. Some
              parts of this bay are protected, so construction and even tourism
              are prohibited in them. In those places where there is no ban, the
              place is full of tourists. The origin of the name of this island
              is also interesting. His name in translation means one who goes
              down to the sea. Apart from beautiful islands, this place is full
              of sea rocks and caves. The small islands are stunning.
