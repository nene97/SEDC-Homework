              The Colosseum is the perfect symbol of the power of the Roman
              Empire at its height. Dating back to 72 AD, it was designed to
              hold 50,000 spectators and was, at the time, the biggest
              amphitheater ever built. Here, all manner of public spectacles
              were shown – from animal hunts and executions to gory gladiator
              battles; it was even filled with water for mock sea battles.
              Although practically a ruin, the Colosseum is still very much an
              icon of Rome. Step inside the arches and take a tour of the
              structure. Sit and imagine yourself as a spectator in Roman times,
              and the grand displays and spectacles that went on inside the
              ring.

              Venice is the original canal city; every other canal city in the
              world is compared to Venice. The enigmatic waterlogged city is the
              site of more than 150 waterways and 400 bridges, including the
              famous Bridge of Sighs. The main canal in Venice is the
              two-mile-long Grand Canal, which flows past St Mark’s Square and
              is lined with some of Venice’s historic architecture – from the
              Medieval to the baroque. Gondoliers punt visitors around wearing
              striped shirts and wide-brimmed hats, but boats on the river are
              not just for tourists; they are also used for everyday jobs such
              as rubbish collection.

            <p>
              One of the architectural projects of “Mad” King Ludwig II of
              Bavaria, Neuschwanstein Castle is the quintessential fairytale
              castle. In fact, it was the castle’s soaring spires and romanesque
              revival style that inspired Walt Disney’s Sleeping Beauty Castle.
              Construction of the castle began in 1869, but sadly, Ludwig never
              got to live in his castle; he died in 1886, the same year of the
              castle’s completion. Set in South Bavaria among forested mountains
              and mirror-like lakes, the picturesque setting of the castle is as
              impressive as the building itself.
